The name of project:"WallScan Pro: Material Detection System"


Problem Statement
Building construction and renovation projects often require a comprehensive understanding of the materials used in existing structures, particularly walls. Traditional methods for assessing wall materials can be invasive, costly, and time-consuming, often leading to delays and additional expenses. There is a need for a non-destructive, reliable, and efficient system to detect and identify wall materials to aid in construction, renovation, and property assessments.


Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a non-destructive sensor-based system, "WallScan Pro", that can detect and identify the materials used in walls. This system aims to provide accurate and immediate information about wall composition, enabling stakeholders such as contractors, property inspectors, and potential buyers to make informed decisions without causing structural damage.

Requirements and Tools
To achieve the objectives of "WallScan Pro", the following requirements and tools are necessary:

Hardware Components:
Microcontroller/Processor: To control the sensors and process data. Popular options include Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32.
Sensors:
Ultrasonic sensors for density analysis.
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for structural analysis.
Infrared (IR) sensors for heat pattern recognition.
Resistivity sensors to measure electrical resistivity of wall materials.
Power Supply: A stable source, either from the grid or batteries, with provisions for power management to ensure prolonged use.
Communication and Storage:
Wireless Communication: Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to transfer data to other devices or the cloud.
Data Storage: Local storage for sensor data, with optional cloud storage for larger datasets or remote access.
Software Components:
